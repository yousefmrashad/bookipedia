##  Getting Started

**System Requirements:**

* **Operating System**: Only 64-bit Linux systems are currently supported.
* **Python**: `version 3.10.x` (It is recommended to create a clean environment for the server)
* **CUDA**: A functioning CUDA and cuDNN environment with a minimum CUDA version of `11.x`.

###  Installation

#### From `source`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are not using Docker Compose, you must have a local instance of Weaviate running.
> You can run it using:
> `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50051:50051 cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:1.30.0`

1. Clone the bookipedia repository:
   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/yousefmrashad/bookipedia
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```console
   $ cd bookipedia
   ```
3. Install the dependencies using uv:
   ```console
   $ uv sync
   ```

**From Docker**

1. Clone the bookipedia repository:
   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/yousefmrashad/bookipedia
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:

   $ docker-compose build
   ```

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

1.  Copy the example environment file:

    ```
2.  Open `.env` and fill in your API keys:
    *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Required for Google-based services.
    *   `OPEN_AI_KEY`: Required if using OpenAI models.
    *   `WEAVIATE_HOST`: The host of the Weaviate instance (default: `localhost`).
    *   `WEAVIATE_PORT`: The port of the Weaviate instance (default: `8080`).
    *   `WEAVIATE_GRPC_PORT`: The gRPC port of the Weaviate instance (default: `50051`).

#### Models Setup

The Piper TTS model needs to be downloaded manually.
Please follow the instructions in [models/README.md](models/README.md) to download and place the required model files in the `models/` directory.

#### Advanced Configuration

For deeper customization (e.g., changing model names, chunk sizes, backend URLs), you can modify `src/bookipedia_ai/utils/config.py`.

###  Usage

#### From `source`

Run the server using the command below:
```console
$ uv run bookipedia-ai
```
or using the python module:
```console
$ uv run python -m bookipedia_ai
```

**From Docker**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure you have configured your [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) and completed the [Models Setup](#models-setup) before running the command below.

Run the server and the database using docker-compose:
```console
$ docker-compose up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you modify the source code, run `docker-compose up --build` to apply the changes.
